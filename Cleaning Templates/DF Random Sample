Title: Randomly sample a pandas dataframe

Description: 
The first step in data cleaning is to quickly get an idea of what is inside your dataset. Randomly picking a few rows to view will help you achieve that. 

print(df.take(np.random.permutation(len(df))[:2]))

this command uses 3 functions df.take (), np.random.permutation() and len() to print 2 randomly selected rows from the dataframe df(). 

len() just measures the length of the dataframe which serves as an input to np.random.permutation(). The value 2 indicates that any 2 rows can be picked up at random by the function. 

df.take() selects rows from the dataframe. If you did not want to randomly pick rows, then you can just pass the number of rows as a parameter to df.take().
