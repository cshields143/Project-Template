Naming Conventions - make them similar for projects when possible
        df(1,2,3,4) = df1, df2, df3 however many datasets we need
        df_copy (copy)
        df_text (for text analysis)
        df_nn (neural network)
        
        ffm = fast first model and subseq. exploration models (1,2,3,4 to show which model you're on)
        model = final model
        nn_model = neural network model
        
        FUNCTIONS:
          if it affects the df, put df_ in front. 
          if it affects the model, put ffm_ in front.
          etc.
